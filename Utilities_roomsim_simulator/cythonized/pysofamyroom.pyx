One thing I don't understand: where does the LoadCRoomSetup come from? I don't see it defined anywhere in the code. 
This is just reading the txt file into the CRoomSetup, maybe we don't need it, this is not the time consuming part. 
Validate setup is still usable though (but the code is very small, maybe we want to handle our errors, but why not use it.)
--> The main will change. We'll get a CRoomSetup in the input, and return wav (probably)

Everything in one file for now, but eventually we'll move to several files to expose only what we want 
as here https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/clibraries.html


The only important string is the receiver's description, apprently passing strings is not so simple. 
See this https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/strings.html.

# TODO: Understand the code behind wav saving. I'm not sure I understand the loops. 
# What if we only retrieve the response in response = Roomsim(&setup);
# In this case, we'll also need to expose the post generation cleaning, and call it from python? 
# We'll have to see how that works.  


# TODO: write a very small example with a struct, a function that expects it and adds the fields
# two simple ints will be fine. And then, complexify.

# TODO: The receivers and the sources are arrays of Struct, which seems complicated to
